# mp4-to-mp3
I like having some music on disk, help me concentrate when I code.
With time the playlist tends to grow and takes quite some space.
mp4-to-mp3 saves space by keeping the sound and dropping the video.

# Warning
The script assumes /tmp is writable and moves the orignial videos.
It explores all the tree below the current directory.

# Examples
mp3-to-mp4.sh only shows the help, use arguement "GO" to proceed.
