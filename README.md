# mp4-to-mp3
I like having music on disk, no ads, helps focussing while I code.
Over time, that playlist tends to grow and take up quite some space.
mp4-to-mp3 saves space by keeping the sound and dropping the video.

# Warning
The script assumes /tmp is writable and moves the original videos.
It explores all the tree below the current directory.

# Examples
mp3-to-mp4.sh only displays the help, use argument "GO" to proceed.

$ cd Music
